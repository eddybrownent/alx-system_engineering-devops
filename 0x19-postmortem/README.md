0x19. Postmortem

DevOps Sys Admin

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

    To provide the rest of the companyâ€™s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
    And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.


Issue Summary:

    Duration: The outage occurred from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM (UTC-5).
    Impact: Our e-commerce website experienced downtime, affecting 30% of our users who were unable to access our platform.
    Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer that led to a surge in traffic to a single server, causing it to become unresponsive.

Timeline:

    9:00 AM: The issue was detected when our monitoring system triggered an alert for high server load.
    9:10 AM: Engineers began investigating the issue, assuming it was a sudden traffic spike due to a marketing campaign.
    9:30 AM: The team noticed a significant drop in server response times and decided to scale up the server fleet to handle increased traffic.
    10:00 AM: As the issue persisted, we engaged the database team to investigate potential database bottlenecks.
    10:30 AM: Despite the scaling efforts, the service degradation continued. An incident was escalated to senior DevOps and infrastructure engineers.
    11:00 AM: After reviewing the logs and monitoring data, it became evident that the load balancer was sending all traffic to a single server.
    11:15 AM: The load balancer misconfiguration was identified as the root cause of the issue.
    11:30 AM: The load balancer configuration was corrected, and the website service was fully restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer. Due to this misconfiguration, all incoming traffic was directed to a single server, overwhelming it and causing it to become unresponsive.

The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration. We adjusted the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic across the server fleet, ensuring that no single server would be overloaded. This change was tested and validated in a controlled environment before being deployed to the production system.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar outages in the future, we will take the following corrective and preventative measures:

    Load Balancer Configuration Review: Implement regular reviews of load balancer configurations to identify potential issues before they impact the service.

    Automated Scaling Policies: Develop automated scaling policies that can dynamically adjust the server fleet based on traffic patterns, reducing the manual intervention required during traffic spikes.

    Enhanced Monitoring: Improve our monitoring system to provide real-time traffic insights and automated alerts to detect and respond to anomalies more swiftly.

    Incident Response Training: Conduct incident response training for all teams to ensure faster identification and resolution of issues.

    Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Document the root cause analysis and resolution process, making it available to all teams for learning and reference.

    Load Testing: Implement regular load testing of the platform to identify any vulnerabilities and bottlenecks.
